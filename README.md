# Bionic-prosthesis-on-Arduino
## A bionic prosthesis controlled through DIY muscle sensors attached to an Arduino board

Instead of using commerical EMG sensors, we've built our own sensors from scratch using electronic components. The raw low-amplitude noisy muscle voltages should be filtered, amplified and rectified to control the servomotors' motion. You can assemble you own circuit using the schematic provided in the repository

For processing the signals and controlling the servomotors, we used the Arduino board and Adafruit Servo Shield. 

The initial hand prosthesis design was taken from https://mdesigns.space/ and has been re-designed for our project.
